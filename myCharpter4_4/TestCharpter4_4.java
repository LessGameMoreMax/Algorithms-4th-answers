//Bellman-Ford 算法最坏情况
//	Bellman-Ford queue never empties.
//	Show that if there is a negative cycle reachable from the source in the queue-based implementation of the Bellman-Ford 
//	algorithm, then the queue never empties.
//	Solution: Consider a negative cycle and suppose that distTo[w] <= distTo[v] + length(v, w) for all edges on cycle W. 
//	Summing up this inequality for all edges on the cycle implies that the length of the cycle is nonnegative.
